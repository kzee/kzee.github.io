## Mentoring

I have supervised and mentored over 40 undergraduate and post-bac research assistants and honors students since 2014. My students have been recognized with awards from Columbia University as well as international societies, such as the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, and many have continued on to doctoral programs in psychology and related fields. 
<br>
For my teaching and mentoring effectiveness, I received Columbia University's [Presidential Award for Outstanding Teaching](https://provost.columbia.edu/content/presidential-teaching-awards){target="_blank"} in 2019.
