#Overview
In this demo, I will discuss some issues relating to generalized multilevel modeling. This demo builds on R code and materials I presented as part of the [APA Advanced Training Institute](https://www.apa.org/science/resources/ati/){target="_blank"} workshop on [Intensive Longitudinal Data Analysis in June 2020](https://longitudinalresearchinstitute.com/){target="_blank"}.

You can see a [great tutorial on generalized multilevel modeling by Xiao Yang](https://quantdev.ssri.psu.edu/tutorials/apa-ati-intensive-longitudinal-data-session-j-generalized-multilevel-model-poisson){target="_blank"}, who covered this topic for the 2019 Intensive Longitudinal Data Analysis version of the workshop. 

Here, I will cover similar concepts using a different example and also discuss how to interpret the model output.
