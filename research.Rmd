### *"Life has no blessing like a wise friend."  - Euripides*

I study how interpersonal relationships enable people to cope effectively with challenges and achieve important goals. My work is driven by two main questions: **How can relationship partners support each other effectively? And, how do partners coordinate as a unit?** To answer these questions, my work synthesizes literatures on interpersonal relationships and self-regulation, bridges multiple levels of analysis, and uses a range of methods, including experiments, psychophysiology, and daily experience techniques. I also draw on and develop the best statistical methods available to address these aims. 

<br>

## How can relationship partners support each other effectively? 
A key function of interpersonal relationships is providing social support—practical and emotional assistance for a problem or situation. Although it is often assumed that social support is universally beneficial, empirical evidence for this assumption has been mixed: Receiving support has sometimes been shown to reduce distress, but has also been shown to exacerbate distress and undermine recipients’ feelings of competence. I investigate how social support can be given so it is most beneficial for recipients.  My research integrates theories of self-regulation and motivation to reconcile these mixed findings.  Specifically, my work proposes that social support is most effective when it addresses recipients’ *self-regulatory needs* ([Zee, Cavallo, Flores, Bolger, & Higgins, 2018](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2018-03575-001.html){target="_blank"}; [Zee, Bolger, & Higgins, 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000235){target="_blank"}; [Zee & Kumashiro, 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pere.12298){target="_blank"}; [Cavallo, Zee, & Higgins, 2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167216651852); Cavallo, Zee, & Higgins, in preparation).

In one project, I found that recipients who received support given in a manner (*visible* vs. *invisible*; [Zee & Bolger, 2019, *Current Directions in Psychological Science*](https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721419835214){target="_blank"}) that matched their self-regulatory orientation felt less distressed, experienced higher self-efficacy, and showed tempered cardiovascular reactivity during a laboratory stressor [(Zee et al., 2018, *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*)](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2018-03575-001.html){target="_blank"}.

In subsequent research, I developed a new construct to directly assess the degree to which social support is attuned to recipients’ self-regulatory needs [(Zee, Bolger & Higgins, 2020, *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000235){target="_blank"}. I found that receiving support that better addressed recipients' self-regulatory needs was linked to outcomes that are important for effective self-regulation, such as lower negative mood, greater motivation to persist on a demanding task, and tempered cardiovascular stress. Moreover, receiving support that addressed their self-regulatory needs was linked to greater motivation to perform well on a stressful speech, which in turn predicted better objective speech performance.

## How do relationships contribute to healthy aging?
My research on social relationships and social support also extends to a lifespan context and examines the role of social relationships in promoting healthy aging. My work focuses on how relationship partners promote *developmental regulation*, which involves setting and pursuing goals that enable people to adapt to age-related changes across the lifespan. In one investigation, I found that although feeling younger than one's chronological age (a younger subjective age bias) is known to be associated with health benefits over time, the positive effects of a younger subjective bias are intesified among individuals in higher (vs. lower) quality marital relationships [(Zee & Weiss, 2019, *Psychology and Aging*)](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-25483-003.html){target="_blank"}.

## How do relationship partners coordinate as a unit?
In a second stream of research, I examine how relationship partners coordinate as a unit, especially during challenging situations. My work in this area has largely focused on coregulation in dyadic interactions. Coregulation is a process in which interaction partners’ emotional and physiological states become linked and dynamically influence each other. It is proposed that by regulating as an interdependent unit, partners can draw on each other’s states to maintain or restore an equilibrium level of responding in the face of difficulties.

<br>

### When and why do dyads coregulate? 
First, I investigated when and why dyads engage in coregulation ([Zee & Bolger, 2020, *Multivariate Behavioral Research*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00273171.2019.1699392){target="_blank"}; (Zee & Bolger, 2020, Multivariate Behavioral Research; Zee & Bolger, under review. [Preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/83hpa/){target="_blank"}). I hypothesized that coregulation would emerge during support interactions, when regulation needs are heightened and partners make explicit attempts to help each other return to an equilibrium level. Using an experimental design, I recruited dyads with a preexisting relationship and had them complete control discussions and social support discussions, in which one partner discussed an ongoing stressful issue and the other provided help for this issue, while measuring both partners’ cardiovascular responses. I found that physiological coregulation was more apparent during the support (vs. control) discussions: Through linking their physiology, partners helped stabilize each other’s responses and return more efficiently to an equilibrium state. Moreover, this process was particularly apparent when men received support. These findings provide initial evidence for how dyadic interactions, and social support in particular, engender coregulation. Coordinating with a partner even at the physiological level can be a way to help people manage difficulties and recoup their equilibrium.

<br>

### What are the implications of coregulation for individuals’ success? 
I next investigated the implications of dyadic coregulation for individual self-regulation (Zee & Bolger, in preparation-a). I speculated that drawing on a partner’s calmer state via coregulation might have a stabilizing effect, which then helps individuals self-regulate on their own when facing a stressor. Relationship partners first completed a control discussion (a discussion of their schedules), and then one partner (the "target") was assigned to deliver an impromptu speech. Dyads completed a social support discussion in anticipation of the stressful speech, before the target gave their speech to an ostensible expert. Results revealed that physiological coregulation dynamics during the discussions predicted individual self-regulation dynamics during the speech: Among dyads who showed better coregulation during the support (vs. control) discussion, targets later showed better physiological self-regulation during the stressful speech, indicated by calmer trajectories with decreases in responding over time. This work suggests that physiological and emotional responses are shaped not only by individuals’ own self-regulatory efforts, but are intricately tied to how they coordinate with others in challenging situations

## Statistical Methods
Across these lines of work, I implement cutting-edge statistical methods to address my research aims. These methods allow me to develop and test new hypotheses about how relationships contribute to interpersonal coordination and individual success and assess the generalizability of such effects. Importantly, using these methods enables me to gain understanding of these important processes that would not have been possible with conventional statistical approaches.

### Modeling Between-Subject Heterogeneity 
First, my work involves modeling and interpreting between-subject heterogeneity in experimental and non-experimental effects. Between-subject heterogeneity refers to the notion that research subjects differ in the extent to which they show a “typical” effect; some may show especially strong effects, whereas others may show weak effects or even a reversal in the direction of their effect. In one project, my colleagues and I proposed the importance of working from the assumption that causal processes are heterogeneous and highlighted the utility of multilevel modeling (in particular, random effects) for examining heterogeneity directly [(Bolger, Zee, Rossignac-Milon, & Hassin, 2019, *Journal of Experimental Psychology: General*)](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-19962-002.html){target="_blank"}. Across four studies from cognitive and social psychology, this work revealed that noteworthy between-subject heterogeneity is often present, even in tightly controlled experiments. I have used this approach to understand the extent of variability in my findings and to gauge the role of moderators and boundary conditions to investigate in future studies. My work has also emphasized the importance of heterogeneity for theory development [(Bolger & Zee, Rossignac-Milon, & Hassin, 2019, *Applied Psychology: Health and Wellbeing*)](https://iaap-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aphw.12159){target="_blank"}. 

I have also used random effects to examine sources of heterogeneity beyond subject-level heterogeneity. For example, I have developed a way of summarizing complex results across outcomes and datasets by treating the outcomes and datasets as crossed random effects, while also assessing the degree of heterogeneity in both influences ([Zee et al., 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000235){target="_blank"}; Zee & Bolger, in preparation-b).

```

### Dynamic Modeling
Second, I combine dyadic analysis and time series analysis to model temporal dynamics in interpersonal interactions. Much of my work in this domain has focused on dynamical systems modeling. These models offer valuable insights by capturing the rate of change (velocity) and speed of change (acceleration) in individuals’ or dyads’ responses over time. I have used these models to study self- and coregulatory dynamics ([Zee & Bolger, 2020, *Multivariate Behavioral Research*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00273171.2019.1699392){target="_blank"}). I have combined these dynamic approaches with **Bayesian estimation** to test probability-based hypotheses about patterns of effects (Zee & Bolger, under review. [Preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/83hpa/){target="_blank"}). Such tests are only possible in a Bayesian framework and have allowed me to draw key inferences by summarizing across multiple model parameters. Bayesian models have also proven essential for my research due to their ability to handle complex random effect structures. This has enabled me to estimate, for example, important between-dyad differences in coregulation to reveal a range of possible effects
