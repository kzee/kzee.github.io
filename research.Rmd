### Social Support
A main line of my research program examines mechanisms and consequences of receiving social support (practical and emotional help from others). My research investigates conditions under which receiving social support is helpful versus detrimental for recipients, mechanisms of effective social support, and support provider characteristics that may influence the quality of the social suport they provide. In particular, my work integrates theories of self-regulation and motivation to understand the support process.

### Emotional and Physiological Coregulation during Dyadic Interaction
My research on coregulation during dyadic interaction investigates how dyad members' emotional and physiological responses become linked as they interact and what the implications of such coregulation are for dyadic functioning. The primary context in which I study coregulation is social support interactions between existing relationship partners.

### Social Relationships across the Lifespan
My research on social support and dyadic interaction also extends to a lifespan context, and examines the role of social relationships on healthy aging. In one investigation, I found that although feeling younger than one's chronological age (a younger subjective age bias) is known to be associated with health benefits over time, the positive effects of a younger subjective bias are intesified among individuals in higher quality marital relationships. In a second project, I examine older couples' dyadic support interactions leading up to a laboratory stressor.

### Between-Subject Heterogeneity
I am also interested in the potential for individuals (or dyads) to show heterogeneity in their experimental and non-experimental effects. In collaboration with Niall Bolger, our work has shown that many causal processes show marked variability in their effects. Our work has also proposed the importance of addressing the potential for heterogeneity in theory development.

### Statistical Methods
I am also interested in the development and application of statistical methods. My area of specializations include regression and linear models, multilevel modeling (also known as mixed effects modeling), and dyadic analysis. My teaching experience includes serving as a Teaching Assistant for an advanced graduate course on Analysis of Change (multilevel modeling and working with repeated-measures data). My current research implements dynamical systems modeling of dyadic data, specifically using coupled oscillator models, to examine self-regulation and co-regulation (linkage of partners' responses) during couples' social support interactions.
