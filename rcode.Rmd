Below are some example R scripts I compiled for analyses and plotting. \
More R code is available on my [Github page](https://github.com/kzee){target="_blank"}.

<br>

### [Interaction Effects from Regression Models: Plotting & Simple Slopes](Interactions_Demo.html)
This demo shows how to fit a regression model with interaction effects, plot the results, and run tests on the simple slopes. 

<br>

### [Testing for Differences between Two Coefficients](CoeffDiff_Demo.html)
This demo shows how to test whether two regression coefficients are significantly different from each other using both **Frequentist** and **Bayesian** approaches (with the brms package).

<br>

### [Within- and Between-Subject Centering](Centering_Demo.html)
This demo walks through three different approaches to computing within- and between-subject centered variables in R in preparation for a multilevel analysis. 

<br>

### [Plotting Fixed Effects from Multilevel Models](PlotFixef_Demo.html)
This demo shows how to plot fixed (average) effects from a multilevel model, including how to do so while accounting for a covariate. The demo includes how to plot results from both **Frequentist** models (using the `lme4` package) and **Bayesian** models (using the `brms` package). 

<br>

### [Spaghetti Plot of Multilevel Logistic Regression](LogisticSpaghetti_Demo.html)
This demo shows how to create a spaghetti plot of predicted values from a Bayesian multilevel logistic model.
